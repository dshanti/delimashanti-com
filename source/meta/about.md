Currently a recent graduate from a Journalism degree, I am... a bit of a long story. Born in Indonesia, but grew up mostly in the land of sand, sun and bountiful oil, Qatar, I set out to experience a completely different world by going to Melbourne for tertiary studies at Monash University.
        
I am currently an intern and freelance writer for the following publications:

* Broadsheet
* Everguide
* Neos Kosmos
* Karamel Magazine

My work has also been published on:

* The Vine
* Melbourne Spring Fashion Week blog
* iCreate (Indonesian edition)
* Insider Guides
* NewsHit
* Lotâ€™s Wife

This blog/website will serve as my portfolio, to be used in my attempt at getting a foot in the journalism/media business. Works featured will vary from the published, unpublished to works in progress.
