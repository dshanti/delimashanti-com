The first ever **Redheads Gourmet BBQ Festival** in Melbourne is bringing together local providores, hardware retailers, brewers, wineries and food sellers on 1 – 3 March. Part of the **Melbourne Food and Wine Festival**, this three-day extravaganza will get set the Elwood foreshore alight with a blues music line-up.

Pop-up eateries will join the festival with Phat Brats serving their gourmet hotdogs and Senor BBQ showcasing their signature South American touch. The Smokin’ Barrys food truck will dish out melt-in-your-mouth slow cooked dishes, but leave room for other foodie offerings including Tasty Treats, Grill Pro and Say Cheese.

A barbecue isn’t complete without a couple of beers. Quench your thirst by sampling beers from craft brewers from all over Victoria. The list includes: Red Hill Brewery, King Valley Brewery, Hawthorn Brewery, Hix Brewery, Temple Brewing Company, Red Duck Brewery and Mornington Peninsula Brewery. If you feel like something sweeter, don’t skip ciders on offer including Yarra Valley’s Napoleon Cider and the sweet and crisp Lucky Duck Cider.

Have a drop or two of red to accompany your red meat and try the vino range from Victorian wineries such as Robello Wines, Punt Road Wines and Hickinbotham of Dromana.

Take home grilling hardware and essential ingredients good enough for your backyard barbie. Learn how to use them at the festival’s master classes, demonstrations.



See 20-time USA Grand Champion BBQ Pit Master Andy Groneman from Kansas City, at his Beef Brisket and Pork master classes, while Perth BBQ guru Chris Girvan-Brown will share some pro secrets to firing up your grill. Foodies including Adelaide’s Gilda Ayerst and Melbournian Jess Pryles (AKA Burger Mary) will be in action across the three-day festival as presenters.

Food is the main event at the Gourmet BBQ Festival, but there’s nothing like a serving of blues music to sweeten the deal. So while you’re busy chomping your way through the festival, check out the local blues bands heating up the joint that throughout the festival.
