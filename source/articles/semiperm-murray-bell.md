#Interview: Semi-Permanent Co-Founder, Murray Bell

Since [Semi-Permanent](http://www.semipermanent.com/) launched in 2003, the two-day creative conference has spread throughout Australia and all over the world, with events in Stockholm, Los Angeles, Portland, Hong Kong and New Zealand. Not simply a conference, Semi-Permanent allows emerging and experienced creatives to converge and spread inspiration over a conference, workshops and parties where the young guns can mingle with the top dogs in the industry. 

We spoke with founder Murray Bell, who together with co-founder Andrew Johnstone started Semi-Permanent in Sydney. He spoke about changes in the Australian creative industry.

**Delima Shanti:** So it’s Semi-Permanent’s 11th year, how do you think the design world’s changed in that time?

**Murray Bell:** I think it’s changed quite a bit. Back when we started the event (in 2003) a lot of people seemed to be doing just one thing. You were either just a photographer or an illustrator or a graphic designer. But nowadays I feel like a lot more people are working with a mix of several disciplines. 

I think that’s one of the reasons we started Semi-Permanent; because the design world is so multi-faceted and really many of the disciplines are so inter-connected that it’s great to give photographers, designers, illustrators and other creatives a chance to interact with each other. 

**DS:** How did a two-day conference from Sydney end up going all over the world?

**MB:** With a lot of Frequent Flyer Miles. We started in Sydney and then expanded to around Australia because we felt like there wasn’t anything like it. 

[MB whistles to his dog] Sorry, my dog is walking around in inappropriate places! Anyway, then we reached out to the US and then to Europe and Asia. It was quite a natural expansion, we weren’t forced into it, there was quite a bit of demand. And it’s great for events back in Australia because we go into the centre of the creative industries around the world and meet people that we can then bring to Melbourne or Sydney. 

**DS:** Have you seen a difference in the creative industries around the world in comparison to Australia?

**MB:** Yeah, each city we go to has its own flavour, so we adapt Semi-Permanent to suit the industries the cities. We just got back from the Los Angeles and Portland events. In Portland they have a unique way of life that influences the work that comes out from there. Meanwhile in LA, they’ve got a big focus on the film industry.

**DS:** Australia is quite far away from a lot of other cities with great creative industries. Do you think this creates a sort of concentration of raw original talent?

**MB:** Yeah, I think we have some seriously great talent in Australia. We have the benefit over here of being able to observe design cultures around the world from a distance and at the same time cultivating our own unique brands. 

**DS:** What is the process that goes into choosing the best people to speak at the conference?

**MB:** The job has always been up to me and my business partner [and Semi-Permanent co-founder] Andrew Johnstone. Many people we pick are those we’ve met doing the conference in the US and Europe. We always have a mixture of international and local creative, ad we always try to pick people from a big mix of genres; from photography, design, special effects, magazine editors. 

**DS:** You’ve got the guys from [The Hours](http://www.thehours.com.au/) creative agency coming to speak and they all come from self-taught street art backgrounds... What do you think their business of taking that style of creative work into the commercial space reflect in terms of Australian commercial design? 

**MB:** First off all, we chose them to speak because we’re big fans of their work. I think there’s nothing wrong with artists balancing commercial work and personal work. Not just to pay bills, but sometimes doing commercial work challenges the artists, presents them with projects they might not otherwise be able to do or afford to do and it gives them a sense of responsibility.

**DS:** Do you think there’s this push from major brands to tap into that ‘street’ style of creative work?

**MB:** I certainly think there was a couple of years ago, there was a mainstreaming of street art style work from big brands. But I think it’s actually filtered out a bit now, brands and creatives are creating work for a purpose, not just for the sake for following a trend.

**DS:** I guess a good example of this is [Saint Laurent](http://www.ysl.com/) working with artist [Brian Roettinger](http://brianroettinger.com/) (who will speak in the Sydney conference)
and sending out his artworks before showing a particularly grungy collection for Autumn/Winter 2013. This was in the midst of a major rebranding into targeting a more youthful market so it was a good match.

**MB:** Yea, Brian’s a very smart, very in tune with culture. I met him in LA and he gave me some great insight into how he was collaborating with Saint Laurent’s creative director Hedi Slimane. Brian’s a great example of someone who does his own thing and who wants to work with brands because it’s a great collaboration of talent, not just because the client thinks his work is ‘trendy’.

**DS:** So tell me a bit about the +20 workshop? 

**MB:** That’s a project we’re collaborating with Google on. We’ve tried it out in LA, and it’s basically about giving a group of emerging creatives one-on-one time with a mixture of mentors from Semi-Permanent and Google who will share their knowledge and resources. They all work on a project together for one day, and hopefully it will lead to all sorts of opportunities and lasting relationships between the creatives and mentors. 

**DS:** What do you hope the young creatives will get out of this after +20?

**MB:** Well I’m sure it will be awesome for them to meet some very experienced designers and creative and Google people. I think everyone will have the opportunity to learn from a whole bunch of people who all do very different things. 

**DS:** I’m sure you get many budding designers and other creatives coming to the conference, what do you hope the event will instill in your audiences?

**MB:** I hope it gives them a bit of insight into the creative world outside of Sydney. I also hope they meet as many people as possible, so they can go on and maybe start great projects together. More than anything, I hope people will come out of the Semi-Permanent happy and inspired.
