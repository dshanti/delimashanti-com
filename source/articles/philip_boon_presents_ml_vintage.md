Despite an abundance of cutting-edge, contemporary fashion pieces available today, nothing quite compares to vintage clothing that has stood the test of time and is still as fascinatingly relevant as it was decades ago.

So in celebration of this, at Philip Boon Presents: ML Vintage, stylist Philip Boon will be collaborating with vintage fashion collector and owner of ML Vintage, Mary Lipshut, to celebrate Lipshut’s extensive collection of rare and unworn archive designer pieces. But the best thing about the event? It’s all been organised in the name of charity.

Just one in a series of high fashion charity luncheons planned for 2013 to exhibit the best of the best in Melbourne’s world of fashion, proceeds from every event will be put towards the work of Prahran Mission – a grassroots charity organisation that assists with severe mental illness and aids the socially disadvantaged.

Boon has been supporting their efforts for over 10 years, and it’s through his passion for their progressive charity work and innovative concepts that he feels compelled to lend a helping hand. “I really connect with Prahran Mission’s ideas and philosophies," he says. "They’re really big on ‘art therapy, and it really connects with both myself and Mary Lipshut as creative people.”

Drawing on his years of experience as a stylist and creative director, Boon will work with Lipshut’s extensive vintage collection to pick out highlights from decades worth of fashion treasures. “We will look at doing a cross-section of Mary’s pieces; particularly focusing on Missoni, Pucci and Courrèges,” Boon explains.

In saying so, a significant chunk of Lipshut’s collection that will be showcased for the event include items from the 1970s to early 1980s. Not afraid to express some charming bias, Lipshut simply professes her love for the era, stating: “Even today, I can say that the 70s was the best era for fashion, because there’s one word we used that I don’t think young people today know. That word is elegance.”

Her selected pieces for the show display iconic 1970s styles, including vivid, expressive colours, clever trompe l’oeil prints and plenty of flared trousers. Nevertheless, the collection belies a timelessness that reveals the amazing influence the era has on today’s fashion. Each piece also has a unique story behind them, most of which Lipshut still remembers strongly.

“I had a fashion imports business and had exclusivity over the import of Courrèges and Missoni in Australia. But in the early 1970s, the French tested their first nuclear bombs in the Pacific, and Australia black-banned all French products for two years,” she recalls.

“The fashion changed very quickly and two years later, by the time I could sell my shipment – a shipment that was meant to be for the whole of Australia - the fashion was too far behind!”

Turning to famed Italian fashion journalist Anna Piaggi for advice, Lipshut was told to hold on to her massive collection of two-year-old Courrèges.

“She had great foresight,” she muses. “In 1973 she said, ‘Pack it away, because all over the world museums are going to want to open fashion galleries and vintage fashion will come into its own.’”

Lipshut followed Piaggi’s advice and today she has amassed over 4000 pieces of vintage clothing as well as accessories, all of which are for sale through ML Vintage. However, in a way, Philip Boon Presents: ML Vintage marks the end of an era for Lipshut. Currently going on 89 years old, Mary admits that she wants to be retired by 90.

“I don’t think it’s too young an age to be retired, do you?” Lipshut laughs.

Boon replies, “There hasn’t really been a big fashion show like this showcasing the best of Mary's collection, and really, it’s probably going to be the last event of its kind.”

Philip Boon Presents: ML Vintage was held at Circa on Wednesday 17th April.
