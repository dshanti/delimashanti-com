#Interview: Choreographer Anthony Hamilton

![](/images/anthony-hamilton/anthony1.jpg)

Antony Hamilton is a choreographer, dancer and director who seems to have done way more than most despite his years. The young choreographer has created works for The Lyon Opera Ballet, Australian Dance Theatre, Chunky Move, VCA and plenty more, oh, and he once split his time between ballet and being a B-Boy.

We spoke to Antony about the preparation for his upcoming collaboration with Melbourne-based synth pop band Forces and their performance at Sugar Mountain next week.

**Delima Shanti:** Hi Antony, so tell me what you do?

**Antony Hamilton:** I worked for Chunky Move on an on-and-off basis, they’ve commissioned me to do works with them, and I used to be a performer for them. As a choreographer, I make performances drawn from so many inspirations that I can’t categorise the work in one definition. I work across different mediums quite a bit and there’s a very strong visual design component to my work also.

It’s not solely focused around the concepts of movement and the body - my work is also about creating these unique environments that are foreign and has a somewhat mystical or magical atmosphere to it.

**DS:** You said you don’t exactly categorise your work as such, but where do you get inspiration for your dance work, as well as the visual components?

**AH:** My background in dance is pretty diverse. I trained for a long time with the ballet and I was also a B-Boy at the same time.

**DS:** Wow! That’s a bit different!

**AH:** Yeah, it was a really unusual combination, but mixing the traditional, very disciplined grounding with street dance wasn’t any sort of conscious decision on my part. I think what happened was subconsciously I started drawing from all sorts of resources and I just went along with it. As for the visual component, the inspiration varies, but a lot of the mystical vibes are inspired by science-fiction films.

**DS:** So does your work tend to have a narrative?

**AH:** Well the piece at Sugar Mountain will not really have a narrative, but it will go along with Forces’ set list. It’s really about capturing the gestures and rhythms and the energy of the music, like the movements are responding to the music. I want it to be so that you can’t imagine the music without the dance and visual components, because they’re so engrained with each other.

**DS:** You’ll be collaborating with Forces at Sugar Mountain. What, to you, is the relationship between music and dance?

**AH:** I’ve been influenced quite heavily by the pop culture world. I think our generation is the first generation of performers who relieve ourselves of strict genre definitions. For me, I’ve never shied away from associating “high art” with pop culture. Coming from a hip-hop background, I’ve always had a lot of connection with the music as well.

**DS:** Do you think mixing dance, an art form that is classically thought of to be more high art, with popular music makes it more accessible to the wider public?

**AH:** I don’t know if I agree with the idea that some forms of art are more accessible than others. It’s about good art or bad art. If it’s good people will like it anyway, doesn’t matter if it’s a fringe show or something high-brow.

**DS:** I guess the thing with Sugar Mountain though, is that it does give a wider range of people access to your work, where they may not think to go to dance performance otherwise...

**AH:** Yeah, for me that’s certainly a chance to tap into a different audience. But I’m not going to be changing my style to suit the format.

**DS:** What’s the collaboration process like between you and Forces?

**AH:** At the moment it’s still in the earlier stages and it’s quite a loose process. It was actually the festival’s choice to pair us up as they saw us to be a good match, judging by the aesthetics they demonstrate in their music videos and the visual components I tend to use.

**DS:** So what are you most looking forward to in your performance at Sugar Mountain?
**AH:** We’ve actually got some ideas for audience participation that’ll be really exciting. It’s something that I’m really interested in doing at the moment with some work I’m developing for next year.

I think it’s a good way for audience to feel like they’re a part of the experience. Because I like to create works based in these worlds that are fanciful, involving the audience allows me to bring it closer to earth or even take them along for the ride.
