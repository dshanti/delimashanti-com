#Chef Jake Nicolson enhances freshness with Spiral Foods

Leading Australian health food company, Spiral Foods, has partnered up with Circa Head Chef Jake Nicolson as he takes inspiration from Asian cuisines to come up with recipes to showcase how Spiral’s products can help enhance the flavours of fresh ingredients.

Specialising in contemporary Australian dishes with influences from the Pacific Rim, Nicolson is often inspired by Asian cuisines that make the most of fresh produce using simple ingredients.

Together with Spiral, the Melbourne chef has created his Organic Soba Noodle dish with Herbaceous Leaves, Asparagus and Marinated Tofu – a cold dish prepared using Spiral’s Organic Soba, Ume Plum Vinegar, Pickled Ginger, Sesame Oil, Tamari and Mirin.

Spiral’s range of all-natural Japanese products goes hand-in-hand with Nicolson’s no-fuss approach to food. “Eating healthy is easy and doesn’t mean you have to compromise on flavours.”

Nicolson understands that no matter how good a chef is, a dish is only as good as the ingredients that go into it.

“Spiral’s Tamari and Mirin are perfect ingredients to create the fresh vinaigrette as well as enhance existing flavours from the fresh vegetables. Sometimes making a tasty dish isn’t about cooking a dish to death, it’s about using ingredients to bring the best out of your fresh produce.”

Nicolson took the helm at the Circa kitchen after three years as sous-chef under former head chef Matt Wilkinson. His resume includes stints at world-class restaurants including the two Michelin star The Square in London and Spain’s El Bulli.

Spiral believes good, safe, wholesome food is a basic human right. Spiral Foods is proud of their contribution to help slow the unnecessary changes that are occurring to our earth, climate and oceans. Spiral Foods continue to provide nourishment and wellbeing across the generations of people who care about the food they eat and our earth.
