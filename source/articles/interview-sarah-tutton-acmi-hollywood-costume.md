#ACMI’s Sarah Tutton on Hollywood Costume

Welcome to Hollywood. We had a chat to ACMI’s exhibitions curator Sarah Tutton about their newest Winter Masterpieces exhibition, Hollywood Costume. 

Hollywood has come to Melbourne for three months for ACMI’s Winter Masterpieces exhibition. At Hollywood Costume, Kill Bill’s The Bride hangs out with Scarlett O’Hara, Dorothy, Batman and the lovestruck cowboys of Brokeback Mountain. Well, at least their attire does.

Walking in Hollywood Costume feels a bit like you’ve walked in on a party attended by some of the most recognisable characters in film. The body-less costumes hang almost eerily on mannequins, with screens where the head should be showing slightly moving head shots of the famous actors that once occupied the clothing. 

Curated by American costume designer Deborah Landis, Hollywood Costume is made up of almost 100 costumes. The earliest is a sexy sequined number from Sex (1920) and the most recent are the yet-to-be-installed pieces from The Great Gatsby (they’ll be installed on May 24th, in time for the film's Australian release). 

Sarah Tutton, ACMI’s exhibitions curator says it took Landis five years to track down and gather all of the pieces at the exhibition.

“Costumes are generally not kept [by the actors] after filming, in many cases costumes are returned to the wardrobe department of the film studio and are reused,” she explains. 

“Only in rare cases do people take care of and store their costumes, such as with Robert DeNiro who keeps his costumes and Meryl Streep who was trained in costume design and has an awareness of the cultural important of their costumes.”

Landis had to resort to plenty of detective work to find some of the oldest and most famous pieces. Tutton retells the story behind Judy Garland’s Dorothy outfit from the original Wizard of Oz, saying how Landis tracked down a UK-based woman who had bought the outfit last year. 

“Deborah was asked to come to street corner in London outside a bank with her passport to verify who she was. The owner’s assistant then met her and inside the bank, there it was, the Dorothy dress, red shoes and all!”

Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro each have five of their costumes on display at Hollywood Costume, in a section that explores the relationships and collaboration between great filmmakers, actors and costume designers. 

“I think it goes to show how costumes are props that allow actors to bring characters to life,” Tutton says. “The exhibition demonstrates how it is essentially the coming together of the visions of the director, actor and costume designer that has created some of the most iconic images in film.”


A point the exhibition makes is perhaps the costumes are not iconic on their own; they are iconic because we see them in a character we connect with, in a moment we remember. Many of us would recognise the image of Marylin Monroe standing over a subway vent with her dress billowing around her knees without having ever seen Seven Year Itch. And who doesn’t remember or at least recognise the image of Audrey Hepburn in her black dress and layers of bling staring longingly into Tiffany’s?

In a speech at the opening of the exhibition, Deborah Landis said, “A costume designer has done a good job when the costumes blend seamlessly into the scenery in the film.” 

The statement goes for all costumes in Hollywood Costume; while Kristen Dunst’s glamorously OTT dress for Marie Antoinette looks strange hanging out in the same room as Bruce Willis’ fake-blood-stained singlet from Die Hard, they both are entirely at home in the settings of their respective films. 

*Hollywood Costume runs until Sunday 24 August 2013.*
