#Gig Review: Buckley Ward, Toff in Town,  19 May 2012

Despite receiving attention in the blogosphere since the release of their first album Something in the Night, Buckley Ward have been carving out their path relatively quietly, without many bells and whistles.

There’s something comfortably familiar about the Melbourne band’s fresh-off-the-press second album, So Pretend. It’s hard to grasp exactly what it is that’s so familiar, but if pressed, you would probably think the band’s brand of indie pop - and indeed, the band members themselves - wouldn’t be so out of place in the now-defunct TV show The OC. Probably as the indie-nerd character Seth Cohen’s best friends.

Maybe it’s the combination of jangly melodies reminiscent of Modest Mouse, frontman Jimmy Allen’s Vampire Weekend-esque vocals and a music video that shows the band being chased by zombies that gives off the geek chic vibes, but moving past the been-there-done-that pop feel, there are some definite songwriting gems lurking beneath the cheery harmonies.

So Pretend touches on the toll the daily grind can take on the average Joe. 'Status Quo’ tells of settling for second best and 'Not Enough', the final song on the record, declares that, despite the motions we go through everyday to be somewhat functional, “fatalistic views are never far” and whatever you do is “not enough to keep you dry”. Pretty dark, sure, though it’s often hard to separate the angst and wistfulness from the almost jubilant claps and drum kicks.

Despite the odd lyrical gem, mainly the work of frontman Allen, the band’s downfall is that the steady tempo of the tracks can make them start to blend into each other. It was a struggle after a while to separate the old tracks from the new.

Ending the night with ‘Into The Darkening Blue' (the one with the zombie music video, see below), the five-piece managed to remind us once again why we were there - to listen to some fun, toe-tapping pop tunes.

Had Buckley Ward been around five years earlier, they would be the hottest young things in the pop scene. They make easy-to-digest music that certainly has mass appeal and enough of the catchy factor to make your ears prick up. Safe to say Buckley Ward has a lot of potential to go in the way of other indie-pop greats, but these days you need a bit more oomph than just forlorn lyrics disguised with catchy hooks to catch (and keep) the attention of the average pop fan.
