#Interview: Ignite The Dark Dancer and Choreographer Daniel Ryan

For Daniel Ryan, limits are there to be broken. At least in the world of dance. Sure, purists may believe in excelling in just one form, but others argue that categorising dance into neat boxes, be it ballet, hip hop, salsa or contemporary, can be oppressive to the moving expression of art.
 
For all intents and purposes, Ryan is a jazz dancer and choreographer. But he argues that like any form of performance arts, dance is about presenting a pleasing aesthetic in movement. If some improvisation and dancing out of the box is needed to reach this goal, so be it.
 
Currently working on a dance theatre production called The Pleasure Principle, one of the main things he has stuck his guns to over his 12-year career is pushing boundaries. And he says jazz has allowed him to do just that.
 
“Jazz dance is constantly changing, it's been influenced by so many other dance styles and the popular music of the time," he says. "A lot of the music we use [in The Pleasure Principle] is very now, and with this we bring in influences from hip hop and latin dance."

The Pleasure Principle is the third production by Ignite The Dark, the dance theatre company Ryan co-directs with his partner and fellow dancer Alfie Scalia. The piece, inspired by a Freudean concept, revolves on the idea that the ultimate goal for humans is to go through life seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. The story itself is told in vignettes, with the narrative interwoven with dance sequences.

“We set out to explore human nature, the darker elements, the everyday mundane elements and the sexual elements. We ask, isn’t this all that we want, to be happy?” Ryan muses as the conversation takes a somewhat philosophical turn.
 
From the beginning Ryan and Alfie realised how dance, and jazz in particular, would be the perfect vessel to carry the story. They “thought about jazz as a pleasurable format of performance” and of “using a physical language to tell [the] story”.
 
“This way the story transcends language barriers through movement and it becomes very accessible,” Ryan adds.
 
Ryan says mixing narrative with dance "paints [the performance] with a broader stroke", enabling audiences to take what they want from the piece. That said, he emphasises jazz is not all abstract and is often simple to understand: an angry stare or flirty look from across the stage is exactly what it seems. "I don't want to over-philosofise [sic] things,” he points out. “The piece is like a moving painting, it's clear what is happening in front of you, but it can leave you with different emotional reactions.”
 
As choreographer, Ryan says he tries not to force the story on to individual dancers, instead working with their personalities and sometimes tweaking the original script to fit the dancer. The dancers then read off what may be a straightforward script but "once they perform it, they add a different layer of meaning to the words".

In Melbourne, the dance landscape has changed considerably since both Scalia and Ryan started their dance careers. Both carved out a career like many dancers back in day, through doing odd gigs like music videos. Back then, Ryan says, there were not many independent theatre companies to “work with and nurture new talent”. Today, however, part of the challenge for dancers and companies is exposure.
 
“You've got to be able to draw attention to yourself. One way of doing this for smaller dance groups is by going viral so to speak, maybe by creating a good online presence for yourself,” Ryan suggests.
 
As the conversation comes to an end, we ask for Ryan’s thoughts on where he sees the dance culture going in the future. On the one hand, So You Think You Can Dance and Step Up are coming out with more seasons and sequels each year, on the other you can quite easily and affordably see a New York ballet performance in the comfort of your local cinema.
 
“I'm not a fan of the reality shows. I think it lowers the artistic performance factor and the show is used as an advertising medium,” he says bluntly. “But I think being able to see a ballet performance from New York is an amazing thing; it democratises dance by enabling people from all over the world see great performances. That's the stuff I'd like to see a lot more of.”
 
Meanwhile, the rehearsal process for The Pleasure Principle is a continuous one, right up to the first curtain rise of the season. Both Ryan and Scalia are performing in the piece and are looking forward to debriefing once the season is over, to see how they can continue to push the envelope with their steadily growing company.
