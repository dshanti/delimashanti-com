*Kimbra is one of those musicians who seems to be everywhere, all the time. Whether she's performing at Big Day Out, Groovin' the Moo, on Saturday Night Live in the US with Gotye or at her own solo gigs, she's hard to miss.*

The large crowd mingling outside St Kilda's Palais Theatre before doors had even opened was telling of the Kiwi-born songstress' impact over the music world. The more mature punters, some of whom admitted to having come straight from their 9-to-5 city jobs, would be forgiven for thinking that the clusters of chatty pre-teens were on their way to Luna Park next door, but the (mainly female) youngsters gave themselves away by snapping pictures in front of Kimbra's gig poster and gushing about how "Omigosh, Cameo Lover is, like, the BEST song".

The somewhat festive mood took a nosedive when the first supporting act, Melbourne jazzy singer/songwriter Sam Lawrence, took to the stage with a lonesome red keyboard. His smooth, caramel-like voice barely filled the theatre and while the keyboard backing would've been enough for a more intimate venue, at the Palais, where audience members had assigned seats and were scattered over two floors, an otherwise decent solo artist can expect to command as much attention as a busker standing on Swanston St in peak-hour walking traffic.

The reception didn't improve much when Daniel Merriweather came to the stage. While he was certainly more memorable than Lawrence, the singer barely got a 'whoooop!' out of the crowd with his heady mix of pop, blues and R'n'B, that sounded like a blend of pre-douche bag John Mayer, Michael Buble and The Script.

By the end of Merriweather's set, much of the sold-out crowd had taken their seats, just in time to catch some delightfully awkward gems. The velvet-voiced crooner debuted 'Vodka', a song from his upcoming EP that involved a questionable chorus considering the all-ages nature of the gig ("I wish I was a little bit stronger like vodka, I was a little bit wiser like Budweiser"). Then came the jazzed-up rendition of Nine Inch Nails' not-quite-PG single 'Closer', before which Merriweather (only slightly jokingly) asked the audience, "Who likes covers? Oh shit, what am I talking about, I built my career on covers." There was nothing quite like the sight of chaperoning mums collectively squirming in their seats when the singer growled "I wanna feel you from the inside, I wanna fuck you like an animal".

Tweeny-boppers, mums and grown-up punters alike were understandably ecstatic when the woman of the night finally skipped onto the stage, tambourine in tow and wearing one of her signature short dresses, this time seemingly an ode to a monster from Where the Wild Things Are. Starting with 'Limbo', Kimbra's deep soulful vocals soared and filled the theatre in a way that her supporting acts' couldn't. In hindsight, the difference was Kimbra actually looked like she was having fun, and that she wanted her audience to have just as much fun themselves. Watching the singer strut, jump, hop and dance across the stage was awe-inspiring.

Considering she is now only 22-years-old and was discovered when she was 17, Kimbra carried herself through the set like a performer who has been in the business for many years. She tightly navigated in and out of slower, jazzier numbers like 'Old Flame' and 'Plain Gold Ring', and gestured through the more poppy 'Settle Down' and 'Two Way Street' like an energetic orchestra conductor, her tambourine as her baton.

A cool backdrop of digital screens added an extra punch to the colourful light work. Add Kimbra's infectious cheery attitude on top of that and you've got perfect conditions for a dance, but the ushers weren't having any of that sort of unruly behaviour, getting anyone moving outside of their aisle to go back and wiggle in their seats instead. In true pop princess fashion, Kimbra slipped away for a costume change mid-way through her set, before welcoming Sam Lawrence back on stage for a duet on 'Wandering Limbs'. This time Lawrence was more lively, though Kimbra clearly dominated the stage.

Thank God that a solo rendition of the now overplayed 'Someone that I Used To Know' was not attempted, and the omission of a fake exit plus encore was refreshing. The show instead ended with a bang with 'Cameo Lover', epic shower of confetti and all.
