#Interview: Hungry Kids of Hungary's Dean McGrath

With two years’ worth of touring under their belts, Brisbane's Hungry Kids of Hungary have returned to Australia as a more mature band.

We caught up with frontman and lead singer Dean McGrath to quiz them about the making of their second record, what it feels like to be back on home turf and what you get when you put four guys in a bus for weeks on end (pretty much what you'd imagine, basically).

**Delima Shanti:** Hey Dean, how's it going where you are?

**Dean McGrath:** We just played the first show of the Australian tour last night, so we’re in recovery mode. I’m dying in the ridiculous heat here in Brisbane.
 
**DS:** Two years between albums probably seems like a long time. When did you feel it was the right time to get cracking on a second album?

**DM:** We were touring a lot and the [touring] cycle for the first album was actually extended as we took on more gigs in the US and around Europe. But when Escapades was recorded and released, I think we pretty much started work on the second album straight away, as soon as we had the opportunity to sit down and put our heads together.
 
**DS:** How was the writing and recording experience different to when you were recording the first album?

**DM:** The first album was more of a compilation of songs that we’d done over three years, so we never really sat down to write the record, with a vision of what the album was going to be. We had been releasing a couple of EPs and played songs live and we basically just picked the ones we liked and put them in the record. Whereas with You’re A Shadow, from the very beginning we had a game plan; we’re making another album and we’re going to write songs that are all going to sound great together.
 
**DS:** Where does the whole starting a new record journey start... Do you all just sit together in one room and start brainstorming?

**DM:** Kane [Mazlin] and I have always taken on the songwriting duties, but we tend to work quite separately. We’ll work separately from home and record things and send it to the rest of the guys, then we pick through it together. Obviously the thought processes started really early on and we were on the same page on what kind of record we wanted to make.
 
But it’s weird, I remember getting the first demo for the new record from Kane and I’d already started work on a few songs - it was actually a demo for our first single, 'Sharp Shooter' - I listened to it and thought, “Oh my god, he’s read my mind!” He was doing the exact kind of thing that I was working on!

**DS:** Jinx! That is weird. I know you were all in separate bands when you started playing music. Are you guys in sync with each other’s creative styles by now?

**DM:** Absolutely. With every year that goes by Kane and I grow a bit closer in terms of our working styles, and we’ve learned to adapt to each other. When we first started we were quite different and I think this is really audible on our early EPs, where you can tell there’s two songwriters with different ideas working in the band. The great thing about the band now is sometimes it’s difficult to tell who wrote what, or even who’s singing what.
 
**DS:** You’ve said in the past the first album was a bit of a fresh take on the beach-friendly sounds of '60s rock. What influences did you guys draw on for the second album?

**DM:** It’s much of the same original inspirations. We grew up on that kind of music, it was what our parents listened to. We’re massive vinyl nuts and we love our '60s pop like the Beach Boys, the Beatles, the Zombies and that influence is still there. But these things are more inspirations. As a band we’ve grown to develop our own sound.
 
**DS:** Speaking of beach-friendly, after I heard your new single, I wondered if music tends to get more upbeat towards summer festival time. Do you time tours and releases around the summer? Because your music works for it ...

**DM:** It’s funny, I think our record label mentioned something about that! We’ve never been strategic in our thinking, we’ve never thought ‘Oh it’s getting warmer, let do a summer party track!’  I think it just happens that the music we write is really upbeat. *You’re A Shadow* is probably less so than the last one, it’s a bit rougher around the edges, a bit less poppy, but those elements are still there.

**DS:** How were you guys, a young band from Brisbane, received when you went on tour overseas?

**DM:** All of our experiences overseas have been amazing, and it’s great to visit these places to do what we love and play in front of people who have never had the opportunity to hear us before. It’s crazy, we’ve played tiny little clubs in New York where there’s 20 people there,  and a couple of weeks ago we played at the Pukklepop Festival in the Netherlands with 10,000 people there, and we’re so blown away when people know the words to songs we wrote thousands of miles away.
 
**DS:** Tell me about the touring experience: what do you get when you put four guys on a bus for weeks on end?

**DM:** You get absolute madness! You spend so much time on the road with a small group of people and you get cabin fever a little bit. The four of us have got a really strange sense of humour and we’ve got weird in-jokes, so towards the end of the tour when we interact with the supporting band or other people I think they just scratch their head and wonder what we’re on about.
 
**DS:** Do you guys have any pre-gig rituals?

**DM:** Not really, our pre-gig ritual is just to do nothing. I know a lot of bands do that but we’ve never done that at all. We just chill out and when it’s show time we just go out there and do it. We’re just not that disciplined!
 
**DS:** You’ve already embarked on a tour around Australia. What are you most looking forward to in this tour?

**DM:** We’re just really looking forward forward to play in places around Australia we haven’t been to in a long time. This is our first headline tour around Australia in over a year so we’re just excited to playing on home turf again.
 
**DS:** One last thing, what band or artist are you listening a lot to right now?

**DM:** I’m absolutely destroying the Dirty Projectors most recent album [Swing Lo Magellan]. Some of the other guys are obsessed with it too. I’m also loving the new Grizzly Bear record [Shields]. 
 
*You’re A Shadow, Hungry Kids of Hungary’s second album, is due for release on March 2013. Catch the boys on tour around Australia along with support band Gung Ho.*
