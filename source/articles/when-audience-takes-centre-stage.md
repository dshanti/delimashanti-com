#When The Audience Takes Centre Stage

***Walking into the Malthouse Theatre, audiences for Half-Real were greeted by staff handing out remote controls not unlike the slim white remotes of a Wii game console. But to say that this is a group gaming event would not be entirely accurate.***

HALF-REAL is part of this year’s Melbourne Festival, and is one of a handful of events that have chosen to extend a hand and invite the audience for a peek into their imaginative worlds. Audience members are encouraged to roll up their sleeves and dig into a new wave of interactive arts, designed especially to get your hands dirty. Using varying degrees of interactivity, the events’ creators set out to shift the ordinarily rigid conventions of the arts.

Even if one is lucky enough to get the best seat in the house in a performance, the audience member’s role is usually that of a voyeur. The entertainers perform or the artwork is exhibited; we are no more than onlookers or admirers of the work. But what would it be like to pull aside the invisible curtain, the figurative fourth wall, separating the spectator and the work of art?

Described by director Sam Haren as a “choose-your-own-adventure theatrical game”, The Border Project’s Half-Real encourages audiences to solve a whodunit murder mystery by using the purpose-built ZigZag controller (by visual artist Matthew Gardiner) that allows the audience to unfold different scenes and ‘solve’ the crime.

“Depending on what you unlock in the game, [it] will determine your perception of a particular character. Your decision could incriminate the character, or it could prove that they are innocent,” he said.

The director also mentions the concept of the audience’s “gut instinct” and intuition playing a major role in the production, which at first seems at odds with the idea that theatre is always very heavily rehearsed. The high level of interactivity not only allows the audience to essentially drive the labyrinthine narrative, but also to become part of the play. And as no two audiences are alike, each performance of Half-Real is rarely the same. While this may seem to make the ultimate exercise in ad-libbing for the cast, there is only one core plotline and the identity of the murderer and circumstances of the crime do not change.

Amber McMahon, the lead actress in the play, says each actor has to learn “a massive amount” of potential scenes, and be ready to perform them at the drop of a hat.
“Part of the difficulty of being a performer in Half-Real is not knowing what’s coming in the storyline and having to act quickly to get into character,” she said.

“The audiences have taken some bizarre paths, guessing from this person to that person and changing their minds at the last minute as to who the villain is.”

Throughout the performance, an omniscient voiceover refers to the piece as a “game”. Speaking of the production’s trial run in regional South Australia, Haren explains the novel theatre format made the theatre more attractive and accessible for audiences with no prior exposure to it. In arts-saturated Melbourne, the show has sold-out in record time.

While Half-Real’s technological bells and whistles clearly impresses, another Melbourne Festival offering also aims to shift audience perception through direct interaction. Site UnSeen is equal parts theatre, walking tour and multimedia art installation, where audiences quite literally share the ‘stage’ with actors as they walk through the streets of St Kilda for a darkly humorous take on the experience of homelessness.

Co-creator Robyn Szechtman said the “promenade theatre” is a “simulation rather than just a performance”. Throughout the ‘journey’, audiences are confronted by and interact with the caricatural impersonations of street people: fake bag ladies, prostitutes, drug pushers and the like.

Cast member Annie Standford said audiences “quite happily take up the challenge and involve themselves in the performance, when given the opportunity”.

“People learn better through experience. One of the components in Site Unseen is about survival on the streets, where we get audiences involved by having them build makeshift shelters,” she explained.

It is this very component of putting the audience in the homeless people’s shoes that attracted some damning reviews. During the ‘act’, audiences are instructed by the accommodating homeless man Wozza (Chris Bunworth) to build a shelter with the bric-a-brac scattered around a room, while a video montage depicts street scenes coupled with soundscapes aimed at making an immersive experience for audiences. Nevertheless, interaction came across as awkward, forced.

Execution, if anything, is key. Rather than lift the figurative fourth wall, Site Unseen completely removes it, demonstrating that it is not a simple task asking the audience members to essentially act along with the actors. During the simulation of a night on the streets, some audiences were casually lounging on their makeshift beds. Meanwhile, others seem to be very much immersed in the scenario, eyebrows furrowed and shocked precisely on cue.


Similarly, using interactivity to put audiences in characters’ shoes is also present in *It’s a Jungle in Here*, where long-time artist partners Isobel Knowles and Van Sowerwine ask audiences to participate in pseudo-social experiment, this time in the form of a game-like stop-motion art installation. Set in a spacious gallery, the lone piano-like installation invites two people to take a seat and place their faces into peepholes carved into an ornate box, to face a screen showing Knowles’ now signature stop-motion animations. Depicting scenes set on a cardboard train modelled after the Upfield line, cameras transpose the participants’ faces onto animated characters shown on the screen. Participants are then unwittingly forced into the role of attacker or victim and encouraged to respond to a series of increasingly unsettling encounters.

“The whole point was to put yourself in the shoes of the characters and we hope that this is representing a real-life experience that the users can empathise with,” Knowles explains.

An underlying concept with the installation project is the need to strike a balance between the artist’s and participant’s control. Knowles described the tricky task of controlling the way participants engage in the artwork, without too much coaxing or guidance. Luckily, participants at the launch of the installation ‘acted’ with their faces according to the scenes shown on the screen, as expected by the artists.

“Some people expect it to be more like a computer game and other people want to be like a film they’re watching. At the same time, it’s meant to be an artwork,” she said.

The need for a balancing of control is also applicable to Half-Real and Site UnSeen. The latter has been derided by reviewers for its clumsy execution of interactivity. Meanwhile, The Age published a review of Half-Real describing while the techno wizardry created “an intriguing experience”, the hands-on approach made for a jumpy narrative.

So is there such a thing as too much interactivity? A concern among artists and critiques alike is that the concept of audience interaction will fall into the category of gimmickry, but Half-Real director Sam Haren says that it’s all in the execution. “We’re not trying to completely change the theatre experience; we’re interested in how we can use technology to invigorate the core part of a live experience. It would be gimmicky if the technology wasn’t used to push the narrative and was just there to look cool.”

Sowerwine mentions that technological developments have created new platforms on which artists are able to showcase their work, allowing the potential to increase audiences. Nevertheless, there’s no denying that as audiences, sometimes all we can do is sit back and enjoy the show. And while this way of consuming an artistic piece is not going anywhere, the examples mentioned show that audience are not only integral parts to a performance, they also make potential art material.
