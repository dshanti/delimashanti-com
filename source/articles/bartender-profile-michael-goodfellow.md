#Bartender Profile: LongPlay's Michael Goodfellow

LongPlay is well known for being a great locals bar. It’s the type of place where you can comfortably wind down or visit over the weekend for some classic cocktails and a bowl of salted nuts. The bartenders here have garnered a great following, so we decided to speak with Michael Goodfellow to ask him what it’s like working at a local favourite.  
  
**What got you into bartending?**

I started bartending about three years ago and before that I had been DJing professionally at bars and parties for well over 10 years. I was around cocktails and cocktail makers all the time and I just had a go at it. I ended up really enjoying it – serving people feels like being part of a community. Being a bartender at such a popular local place is almost like taking on the role of the local butcher, hairdresser or barista.

 
**Is there a secret to running a bar that people keep coming back to?**

People keep coming back because of the consistency of service and the quality of the drinks. It’s also about having fun with people who come to the bar; it’s really lucky for us that we get so many interesting characters coming to the bar.


**What do you think is the most ordered cocktail at the bar?**

I particularly like making Old Fashioned cocktails for people, because I’m just really passionate about the particular way they’re put together. You can’t just throw in the main ingredients together hoping you get the right flavours – there’s quite a bit of consideration and care to get it just right.


**Do you ever experiment with just mixing a bunch of ingredients and seeing what you get?**

Definitely, it feels like I’m experimenting with a chemistry set sometimes. Recently, I’ve discovered that I like a dash of soda with certain things. For example, sometimes I make a regular cocktail on ice and then add a bit of soda to it and it feels less like a cocktail and more like a refreshing flavoured drink.

 
**Where do you get your mixing inspiration from?**

I get inspired from really good products, or maybe a couple of them together. After tasting them individually, I might try to see how I can mix and balance them together. For example, it might be a case of adding a few dashes of one thing to another to bring out a certain flavour. 

 

**What’s your favourite cocktail?**

A well made Manhattan is really great. In winter, I find that it’s really warming and you can take your time with it, sipping slowly.
