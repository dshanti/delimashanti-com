#Review: Never Did Me Any Harm, Melbourne Festival 2012

![](/images/ndmah/ndmah1.jpg)

To the novice theatre-goer, the dance/theatre performance genre normally conjures images of people in unitards and movements not unlike that in Napoleon Dynamite’s Happy Hands Club. So it was with a sense of relief when I sat down at the Melbourne Festival performance of *Never Did Me Any Harm* (a collaboration between Force Majeure and Sydney Theatre Company) and was faced with performers in slacks and old t-shirts, on a backyard set that could be any old garden if not for the Astro turf.

Using Christos Tsiolkas’ *The Slap*, in which a parent slaps a child who is not his own, as a jumping off point, director and choreographer Kate Champion explores that constantly contested subject: parenting. While we’re at it, it’s interesting to note neither Champion nor Tsiolkas are parents.

But to say *Never Did Me Any Harm* was based on The Slap would be an overstatement. Kate Champion originally toyed with the idea of taking the book to stage, but instead decided to approach the subject matter as broadly as possible. The whole point of this work was not to have a straightforward narrative with clearly defined characters, or to be tied down to one.

In preparation for this dance/theatre work, the Force Majeure team interviewed parents from all ages and backgrounds to amass a sufficient cross-section of the types of parenting out there. From the ‘helicopter parent’ to the tough love supporter, the convincing portrayals induced plenty of knowing chuckles from parents in the audience. 

Set in a quintessentially Australian backyard, with toys and garden furniture strewn willy-nilly, Never Did Me Any Harm could have been about any family. The cast of six changes roles throughout short vignettes in the one-hour long performance, switching from child, to adult, then back to child again, as they quote word-for-word the parents and children they interviewed in pre-production. As parents, the performers ask: Isn’t this supposed to be more rewarding? Is it wrong to dislike children? How far do you have to be pushed for punishing children to be okay?

The dance element came in mainly as exaggerated everyday movements integrated with the script. In one of the funnier dance scenes, Alan Flowers plays a convincing child who wouldn’t stand still for a family picture, frustrating his parents who end up arguing. The conspicuously pregnant Sarah Jayne Howard (who has been pregnant for as long as the show has been making the rounds on the festival circuit) also stunned with an intimate duet with Joshua Mu, portraying the fraught relationship between parents about to have a baby. In a separate vignette, Mu takes on the persona of an autistic child and has a dark solo with his ‘shadow’ – a projected mirror image of the dancer – representing his out-of-body experience as someone with autism. 

The unexpected drawcard in the performance though was the stunning projections by Chris Petridis. At times projected computer grids ripple and shake to express trapped rage and frustration and at other times provocative text creeps across the set, spelling out what the characters are thinking and feeling. The haunting, throbbing sound design by Maz Lyandvert added an extra texture to the movement of the performers.

*Never Did Me Any Harm* takes a topic that has been a staple of daytime talk shows and self-help books for decades and pokes fun at it in a good-natured way, making it interesting again. Even audience members who are not parents can relate to the performance. After all, whether we like to admit it or not, the way our parents raised us have had at least some impact on how we’ve turned out. 

Finally, it’s great to see the lines between theatre and dance blurred and actors dancing in the sense of structured, expressive movements which enhance the overall performance, rather than in the jazz hands musical sense. It’s also great to see the performances in no way resembled Napoleon Dynamite’s Happy Hands Club. 

***Never Did Me Any Harm ran as part of the Melbourne Festival in October 2012.***
