#Luxury Brands Buck Dwindling Retail Trends

The emergence of quality shopping centres is underpinning the recovery for luxury brands in Australia, according to a report by real estate specialists Colliers International.

Despite the recent economic downturn, global luxury brands saw Australia as a secure destination to invest in, with Australian consumers still showcasing a desire for luxury goods.

“While many global luxury brands do not yet view Australia as a profitable market, in terms of critical mass, they recognise that we are a market that proved robust during the recent economic downturn,” the report said.

While the world was reeling from the global financial crisis, Australia had been erecting shopping destinations modelled after their counterparts in Asia.  Sydney’s Westfield shopping centre reopened accompanied by a total of 16 luxury brands the likes of designer brands Diane von Furstenberg, shoemaker Christian Loubutin and high-end men’s department store Harrod’s.

Meanwhile, Chadstone Shopping Centre cemented its position as ‘The Fashion Capital’ in 2009 by unveiling its luxury section. The section boasts fashion heavy weights such as Miu Miu and Chanel and its location meant the glitzy retailers had the opportunity to penetrate a new market, made up of an affluent suburban population who are less ostentatious as the traditional Louis Vuitton-toting and Chanel-wearing consumer.

Melinda O’Rourke, Director of retail consultancy firm MO Luxury, says Australia’s sophisticated market and consumer “hunger” for luxury brands due to proximity away from the world’s fashion capitals are some factors which attract high-end brands.

“Since the global financial crisis people have been more concerned with value, making sure their purchases last,” Ms O’Rourke said.

“People are not buying a lot of luxury items, but they are spending a lot when they do. Target consumers are also prepared to spend a premium price on a luxury item, considering it an investment.”

The trend is in stark contrast to sales performances of lower-end Australian retailers, with David Jones and Myer failing to revive ‘flat’ sales performances in the first half of this year, despite heavy discounting.

Nora Farren, Colliers International Director of Research, said in a statement that market segmentation has influenced performance, with consumer preferring to shop at “either the high or low end of the market”.

“This is resulting in a polarisation of retail with the bargain and premium sectors benefitting most, and middle market retailers losing ground,” Ms Farren said.

“Luxury brands don’t compromise on value by discounting. The target market is interested in the brand history, quality and exclusivity, and for some people this is priceless.”

This article was meant to be a break-out story to accompany a longer business feature. At the time of writing, I was interested in how Chadstone Shopping Centre among other shopping centres thought expanding their business into luxury brands would be a safe bet despite continuing low consumer spending rates.***
