#Melbourne International Film Festival Next Gen Program Preview - Valentine Road

![](/images/valentine-road/valentine-road.jpg)

If you think the Melbourne International Film Festival (MIFF) Next Gen program is just the kid-friendly section of the festival, then you might want to take another look when the full program comes out on July 15. The Next Gen films aim to enrich the cinema experience for younger audiences through presenting a range of films that may not necessarily have been made solely with younger viewers in minds, but are nevertheless beneficial for both young and adult audiences. 

Special classification exemptions have been put in place in the Next Gen program to allow young film buffs to have their pick of cinematic goodies throughout MIFF. The common denominator with the films is they do not talk down to the viewers but rather present topics such as growing up, discovering identities, prejudice and violence in an intelligent manner.

One of these films is **Valentine Road**, a stirring documentary based on the 2008 murder of Lawrence ‘Larry’ King, a queer Hispanic 15-year-old and the impact his death left in the community.

Taking place in Oxnard, Los Angeles, Valentine Road follows the aftermath of Lawrence ‘Larry’ King’s death, an 8th grader shot in class by fellow student Brandon McInerney for expressing himself as transgender. The documentary looks at how fellow students, teachers, the police, media, local community and the rest of the country reacted to the execution-style murder. 

The film presents a stark insight into the reactions of the local and wider communities, with views ranging from the callous “He asked for it” to “He was a victim of hate crime”. However, Valentine Road commendably does not avoid the complicated nature of the case. The film sheds light on the equally violent early childhoods of both Larry and Brandon. Whilst Larry was abandoned and beaten for being queer, Brandon’s childhood was no better, having been exposed to extreme violence, drug abuse and white supremacy philosophies. 

Throughout the film, viewers are asked to form their own opinions of this extremely unfortunate tragedy. We are asked to question the decision by prosecutors to put Brandon McInerney to trial as an adult despite the fact he had just turned 14 at the time of the murder. In the director’s hindsight, it was blindingly obvious that while Brandon was tried as an adult, jurors could not get past the fact that he was legally still a child, although he still got a 21-year sentence. 

Viewers are also confronted with how teachers responded to Larry’s decision to start expressing his sexuality in a more outward manner by acting and dressing in a more effeminate manner. Had they any right to try to coach Larry into suppressing his more effeminate behaviours in school, on the basis of protecting him from bullies? Would it have meant Larry would still be alive today? Did the well-meaning teacher who gave Larry an old homecoming dress help set off a chain of events? 

Valentine Road is a great taster to the Next Gen Program. Similar themes of peer pressure, teen violence and prejudice will be explored in films including What Richard Did, Blackbird and I Declare War . At a glance, the program looks set to be a cracker, presenting films that resonate with wide audiences and are sure to be great conversation fodder when the festival comes around. 

The full MIFF program will be released on July 15th along with The Age. Over 4 weeks, 110 films will be screened in cinemas across Melbourne, with 21 films screening straight from Cannes Festival. 


*Melbourne International Film Festival runs from 25 July to 11 August 2013.*
