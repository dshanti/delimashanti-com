#Get your food pawn fix at Pawn & Co.

Here's a little something to get you excited for the weekend. 

Whip out your camera phone and get down and dirty with Pawn & Co.'s saucy meatballs, succulent sliders and sticky sweet treats, courtesy of the Food Pawn kitchen.

Josh Lefers and Stephen Wools, owners of Chapel Street's new Prohibition Era-inspired cocktail joint, have drawn on New Orleans' rich culinary heritage for the bar's food and cocktail menu. 

Crafted by Jasmin Lefers of Sis Made This, the food focuses on sliders and meatballs chockfull of unabashedly All-American ingredients and flavours.

Lounge among the seedy glamour with a Basic Slider or a Bowl of Balls, which includes a choice of saucy balls on a dinner roll. Choose from Jamaican Chicken and Banana, Beef Bacon Cheeseburger or Pork, Fennel and Apple.

If you like your veggies, pick the Fish and Flaxseed Balls or the Quinoa, Smoked Eggplant and Soy Balls . 


Need a drink with that? Chase your balls with potent shots specially paired to each meatball. There's really no better way to wash down the Beef Bacon Cheeseburger balls than with a shot of Jack Daniels and apple Messanez. 

Paying tribute to the Green Fairy cocktail's birthplace, Pawn's New Orleans Absinthe Cocktails will have you drinking like Mark Twain and his buddies in the 1870s.

Travel through America with the 'Pan American Clipper', a heady mix of Laird's Applejack and Echleberger 68 Absinthe with citrus and pomegranate syrups.

Each tipple here has a story and the Classics cocktail list includes the 'Hemingway Daiquiri' and the Bond-inspired martini 'Vesper'.

Don't miss Pawn & Co.'s signature Southern-tinged cocktails. Swig a mugful of the Cognac-based 'Georgetown Swizzle', taste the tropics with Coco 'n' Oil and make sure you hold on while you sip on a 'Bucking Mule'. Then let the good times roll.
