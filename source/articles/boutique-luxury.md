#A Boutique Luxury

*Boutique hotels are offering an alternative escape plan for travellers from near and far. We speak with Simon Westcott, managing director of Mr & Mrs Smith
about what makes such accommodation options worth your while.*

With international travel now more accessible than it ever has been, travellers are constantly expecting more from their accommodation. Where we once expected little more than a room and a bed to rest our weary heads, the boutique hotel experience is changing the way we think about travel.

The rising popularity of boutique accommodation reflects the changing attitude of consumers as opposed to the industry itself. Whether travelling for business or pleasure, customers are seeking hotel experiences tailored to their discerning sensibilities, rather than settling for accommodation that lacks in personality and is created for a mass audience.

After recognising this market shift, the boutique hotel directory website Mr & Mrs Smith acted upon their instincts and have now been helping us locate the best hotels from Melbourne to the Maldives for almost a decade. In describing the boutique choice, managing director Simon Westcott explains: "Style and service are two of the key differentiators between a boutique hotel and a hotel within a larger chain.

"Boutique hotels are generally smaller in scale and often independently owned," he adds. "So there’s an intimacy and individuality when it comes to personal service, and a freedom when it comes to design that bigger hotels usually can’t replicate."

This is certainly now the case in Melbourne, where many boutique hotels celebrate individuality by paying homage to the old public houses that once graced our city. And it’s this revival of our old hotels that makes our city one of the world's greatest metropolitan destinations.

Melbourne Pub Group's (MPG) The Prince, for one, is a testament to this culture of rediscovery, whereas Middle Park Hotel seamlessly tips its hat to the style of a true-blue workers’ pub, whilst also capturing the essence of a considered and stylised New York hotel.

In a more contemporary sense, other hotels such as The Cullen appeal to art fans with an eclectic mix of street art and works by Australian artist Adam Cullen throughout its halls. Would a big, chain hotel group ever be able to offer such touches? Not likely.

"Chain hotels can make you feel like you could be anywhere, whereas the best boutique hotels make you feel local on arrival, with a real sense of place," Westcott urges.

As part of their listings, Mr & Mrs Smith look for, as Westscott puts it, “style and substance, places that are boutique in attitude, if not in scale as well, providing a certain wow factor. Venues such as The Prince made the cut thanks to its spot-on St Kilda location, clean-lined, less-is-more interiors softened by one-off designer pieces, creative dining at Circa and pampering the Aurora Spa.”

Westcott goes on to explain that sometimes it's easier to define what's not a Smith hotel. "We don’t like hotels that are too big, that are garish, have poor service standards or are unwelcoming in any way. We aim to represent the smaller properties around the world that luxury guides and run-of-the-mill directory sites often overlook."

The rise of boutique hotels hasn't escaped the notice of larger international chains. Bigger hotel groups have started to chime in with their own boutique accommodation, such as Accor's new MGallery hotels and the Intercontinental’s Hotel Indigo chain.

"[The big hotel groups] realise that boutique hotels are capturing a younger or more style-aware generation of travellers, and are keen to appeal to that market," Westcott muses. "But it’s hard to compete with the genuine article."
