#Interview: Improv artist Jason Geary or that guy on the iSelect Ads

![](/images/jason-geary/jason1.jpg)

You probably know him as that guy on the iSelect ads, dressed in a grey suit, selling health insurance and [occasionally stealing other people’s chips](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol5jtCNjVDw). But Jason Geary is in fact an accomplished actor, comedian and director who specialises in improv (improvised) theatre. Just as the name suggests, improv theatre or comedy requires the performer to always be ready to spin out lines no matter what gets thrown at them. And with years of experience under his belt, it’s safe to say Geary isn’t the kind of person to struggle with a good comeback. 

Talking to Geary about his latest improv work, he was probably not wearing the grey suit most people have seen him in. The day the interview took place, Geary was taking on his daily duties as Artistic Director of improvised theatre company Impro Melbourne. 

"All the shows are completely made up in front of the audience, this way every performance is unique,” Geary muses. “With shows like the upcoming shows La Muse and If These Walls Could Talk, you'd have a rough idea of the stories you'd want to tell, but the actors have control as well. They're the ones who make up the story at the end of the day, there is very little planning involved." 

Having appeared in improv, comedy skit TV show Thank God You're Here and a Melbourne International Comedy Festival show earlier this year, both La Muse and If These Walls Could Talk (which Geary produced and will be performing in) are slightly different to the comedy roles here is better known for. La Muse weaves live orchestral music through a narrative created on the spot, while If These Walls Could Talk is a fly-on-the-wall look at several generations of a family set in a single room. 

After 17 years in the business, Geary admits it's quite easy to keep things interesting in improv business and to keep creativity blocks at bay. "It's new every time,” he says. ”It's like Christmas; you are giving new gifts every time and every audience gets a slightly different show to the last."

In fact, it's quite easy to not mess things up when you're not following a script, and if something does go wrong, there's always the option of working the mishap into the act. Geary recalls Impro Melbourne's show for the Melbourne Fringe Festival titled Word/Play, where the lighting went out for about five minutes: "It's hard for things to go wrong when you're completely open to whatever happens and whatever line gets thrown at you," he laughs.

Geary's passion for improvised comedy and theatre started way back in high school, where he was written off as "that oddball kid." But how did he get from being Artistic Director of a theatre company to being the face of a health insurance search engine and one of the most recognisable faces on TV next to Rhonda and Ketut?

"I actually used my improv skills to get that job. I was down to the final three (potential iSelect men) and the director was right there, and I decided to be a little playful and improvise the script a little bit," Geary recalls. "A lot of the lines at the end of the ads now are improvised, to the point where the advertising agency don't write a lot of punchlines for me. They just write 'Jason, say something funny here'."

What drives Geary to stay on his toes and break out the funny as required is the audience feedback he gets, whether it's direct from the audience at his Impro Melbourne shows, or double takes from people on the street. "It can be strange doing your grocery shopping and someone coming up to you to say how much they like the ads when it was filmed eight months ago."
