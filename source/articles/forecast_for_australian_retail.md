#Sunny with a chance of rain: A forecast for Australian retail

*In the midst of a decline in consumer spending patterns, online retail comes out as an emerging contender against struggling bricks-and-mortar retailers.*

It is no secret that the online market eBay has changed the way many of us today shop. While for many the first touch point are still the shops, for others the online emporium offers a means to browse thousands of stores before taking the next step towards that retail fix. And eBay being host to a myriad of novice to professional business owners, the consumer is rarely short of choice.

Michael Healy is one such business owner. Starting his eBay venture in 2001, he has since launched two streetwear online stores, Brunswick St. Boutique and Vague Clothing. A recent sighting of Hollywood actress Kristen Stewart wearing one of his sweaters in Germany is telling to the reach that Michael’s business is capable of thanks to the medium.

“Because we sell around the globe, we are not as dependent on domestic sales as physical retail stores are,” Mr Healy said.”We don’t have to worry about renting a space or sales staff.”

In collaboration with online payment service PayPal, eBay released a research paper which reported that the main driver for Australians to purchase goods from international online stores is “easier access to a wide selection of goods at the most competitive prices”. The eCommerce Secure Insight research looked into what the online future is going to look like for Australian consumers and retailers

Ingrid Just, a spokeswoman for the consumer watchdog CHOICE, said despite a third of Australian shoppers buying only from overseas store, there is still a preference to “buy Australian”.

“The fact that we are an island nation has made progress in online trading slow. But local sellers have the geographic advantage that allow them to offer greater customer service and compete against global players,” she said

Ms Just adds that there is potential for further growth in the domestic online sector for easy-to-transport items, such as clothing, footwear and technology.

“The more we get used to online transactions, the more options will open up and more services will be made to consumers,” she said. “ Retailers just need to find the right niche.”

Michael Healy has been doing exactly that. His Vague Clothing range fills a niche on eBay for original street wear with a distinct Australian flair, complete with singlets and hoodies.

“We’re operating locally at this stage, but we are looking to expand our international business once we have a better track and trace logistics system in place,” he said.

But as online trading grows, it is easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. According to a CHOICE report, at the moment online spending only represents three per cent of consumer spending in Australia.

Meanwhile, the broader retail industry  is ailing. The latest D&B National Business Expectations survey, released in May 2011, reveals sales, profit, employment and capital expenditure are expected to falter this year to well below their 10-year averages. The difficult conditions are expected to continue for manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing through to 2012.

Damien Karmelich, corporate affairs director of Dun & Bradstreet, says despite avoiding the worst aspects of the global financial crisis, retailers are still wary of how the future will unfold.

“Economic uncertainly, increasing costs and downturn in consumer spending are all worrying retailers,” Mr Karmelich said. “What determines performance will be innovation. Those that continue with older, more traditional models will struggle to catch up with the other sectors.”

Burberry is one example of a luxury brand who has embraced the growing trend towards online trading. Its online store sells anything from men’s ties to miniscule versions of their trademark trench coat for tiny tots.

Melinda O’Rourke, director of retail services firm MO Luxury, said Burberry’s embrace of the online potential was a surprising one

“Luxury brands tend to stay away from online trading because they don’t want to lose their sense of exclusivity, which risks cheapening the brand,” she said.

Judging by reports of brisk traffic through its new King Street flagship store in Sydney, Burberry has had no trouble drawing attention to its bricks-and-mortar, or rather marble store. And having signed a 15-year-lease with the building’s owner, the City of Sydney, it looks like Burberry is in for the long haul.

But not all companies have been successful. Damien Karmelich said companies are experiencing growing pains as they try to adapt to the online revolution.

Earlier this year, retail giants such as Harvey Norman, Borders, Target and David Jones, spearheaded a campaign to curb offshore purchases by Australian consumers, arguing that the federal government should impose a  goods and services tax on all imported products. At present, there is a GST exemption for items worth less than $1000, and this causes concern among retailers big and small; they fear competition from cheaper low-value imports.

“Retailers need to adapt with the times and find ways to strengthen their business models. With this, they need to plan out for the future,” Mr Karmelich said

The 2011 BRW Business of Retail research discovered that only a third of survey respondents have a documented strategic plan, whilst others either had not developed any plan or could not lay out their plans concretely.

Lisa Tartaglia, research analyst for the Australian Centre for Retail Studies (ACRS) said that businesses need to think about competitors in the market.

“Australian retailers need to think about the product range as well as the price ranges. But price is just an underlying issue, retailers need to think about the consumers and make their satisfaction top priority,” she said.

“The job market is looking good, with unemployment rates at historic lows. The housing market is also picking up, these things come in cycles.”

“It is not simply about how retail conditions are affecting retailers. Consumers come into it too. People have jobs, they have money, but they are lacking confidence. But people are worried about interest rates and cost of living going up,” Tartaglia said. Damien Karmelich argues the issues confronting the retailers do not amount to “a story about retail dying”..

”It is about what retailers can do to pull themselves out of the current retail conditions, and the key to this is [their] attention to consumers.”
