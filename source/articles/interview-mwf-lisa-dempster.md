#Interview: Lisa Dempster, Melbourne Writers Festival Director

[Melbourne Writers Festival (MWF)](http://everguide.com.au/search/?searchString=mwf) comes back this year with a new director and program that’s aimed at appealing to a vast range of audiences from teenage girls to politics enthusiasts. Lisa Dempster, former director of the smaller-scale though no less exciting Emerging Writers Festival, now takes the helm at MWF bringing with her a new direction, great new guests and intriguing topics. We had a chat with her to get a behind-the-scenes look into the making of an international festival, some of her favourite events and the perks of being a festival director.

**Delima Shanti:** So you were director of [Emerging Writers Festival](http://www.emergingwritersfestival.org.au/) from 2009 until last year, what are some of the main differences between your role as director previously and now in Melbourne Writers Festival?

**Lisa Dempster:** It’s actually very hard to compare because they are two very different festivals. Emerging Writers Festival is more geared towards writers, whereas Melbourne Writers Festival is for readers and thinkers. One of the big differences is the scale of the events and with this comes different challenges; the Melbourne Writers Festival is about five times bigger, it runs for longer, there are more events and there are simply more audience members. The Melbourne Writers Festival is also an international event so we try to enable global discussions by bringing in authors from around the world and right across Australia to explore the ‘big picture’ ideas.

**DS:** Is there anything you’ve had to approach differently with the Melbourne Writers festival?

**LD:** There’s quite a few things I wanted to approach differently with the Melbourne Writers Festival; I wanted to increase the festival’s celebratory atmosphere. We’re lucky to live in Melbourne, where there’s so many literary events happening all year round. We’ve aimed for the festival to be an event that brings people together and celebrate the best of writing, reading and intellectual discussions. 

**DS:** So tell me very briefly, what sort of process goes into putting together the program?
**LD:** The team in charge of the program are all great readers and throughout the year we go out to the movies, we read a lot and absorb what’s happening in the world. Then we discuss who we think the most interesting and relevant writers are, and figure out how to include them in the festival. The best metaphor would be that the process is a long conversation with a lot of people involved!

**DS:** That’s certainly sounds a really fun job; talking to people, reading and watching new things all the time! But it’s not just about finding out who the newest bestselling author is, is it? You also have to somehow work out how they will be relevant to the festival-goers...

**LD:** Absolutely! One of the things that I believe very strongly about as a festival director is that the events have to reflect what the people in the city are interested in and what they want to talk about. I don’t start to build a program thinking: ‘This is what I want everyone to be thinking about.’ We approach the program from a grassroots perspective where we look at what people are thinking and talking about at the moment. 

For example, we have very strong political stream this year [titled Future Australia: Politics and Identity] because we’re in an election year and there’s been great waves of change in the political world, so we’ve tried to reflect what issues will be relevant and bring in great writers and commentators who will be able to engage the audience with some hard-hitting topics. Future Australia will look at the big issues and explore who we are as a country, where we’re going and how we’re going to get there. 

**DS:** There’s some really great guests lined up, does part of your role as director create a sort of ‘kid in a candy story’ situation, where you have the freedom to invite people whose works you’ve admired?

**LD:** Definitely, one of the pros of being director of an international writers festival is that I could look at anyone from anywhere in the world and say, “You’re interesting, you’re intriguing, I have to have you!” Tavi Gevinson [editor of [Rookie Mag](http://rookiemag.com/)] was definitely on my list right from the beginning, so I am thrilled that we could make that happen.

**DS:** Who are you most excited to see at the festival? Do you have any personal heroes coming over?

**LD:** I’ve got a few heroes coming over... I don’t like to pick favourites of course, but I am very excited to have [Tao Lin](http://www.taolin.info/) coming. I’ve followed his career right from the beginning and he’s a young, American independent writer who recently got his break-out novel [Taipei] published by Random House. He’s got a very strong voice, an experimental style and he’s very divisive, people either love or hate him. Some people say he’s an absolute genius and the voice of his generation, while others say he’s an internet hack, but I’m really excited to see the person behind this persona. 

**DS:** You’ve got some very fascinating events happening, and you’re launching with [The Moth](http://themoth.org/)… How did that decision come about?

**LD:** The Moth was one of the organisations on my wishlist right from the start. The Moth events are true stories told live, so storytellers are trained to craft a short story and they invite anyone, not just writers, to tell their stories on stage. The events are almost like theatre experience and the connection between audiences and the storyteller makes for an amazing experience.

**DS:** There are so many slam poetry and storytelling events like The Moth being uploaded on to YouTube now... Does this reflect a rising popularity of live storytelling? How much do you think is technology an influence?

**LD:** There’s absolutely a rise in live storytelling and this is only a personal theory, but I think with the internet you can watch author interviews, you can read books and bunch of other things... But what this digital space doesn’t recreate is the magical moment of connection between the storyteller and the audience. This is why there has been a rise in live storytelling, writers are thinking about this connection more and more and audiences are craving the live experience you can’t replicate in the online space.

**DS:** You founded the Digital Writers Conference and the EWFdigital when you were at the Emerging Writers Festival, do you think technology has changed the way the landscape of the writers festival? 

**LD:** Absolutely, we’re doing more in the digital space in the coming Melbourne Writers Festival. There’s so much a festival has in common with social media: it’s a place for people to come together and connect and I think festivals now are more savvy on taking advantage of the digital space to engage with their audiences. One of the themes we are exploring in the festival is how our digital culture is impacting on our creative, commercial and cultural lives.

**DS:** Can you tell me about some of the digital-world-related events you’ve got planned?

**LD:** We’ve got a whole stream based around the digital world. Obviously Tavi is the postergirl of the digital era, we’ve also got Chris Ruen who will discuss ‘Freeloading’ or free file sharing, we’ve got panels on Amazon, digital women, a one-day professional development seminar for writers that’s all about connecting and writing in the online space, and a two-day conference on the future of journalism. 

**DS:** What are your plans for the festival in the coming years? Where are you planning on taking it?

**LD:** I really want the Melbourne Writers Festival to take part in global discussions more. This means finding ways to get the conversations happening here to connect with the conversations happening around the world. 

**DS:** And what do you hope writers and visitors will take away from their experiences at the Writers Festival?

**LD:** I hope the festival will make them think and inspire them, and I always hope the people who come to the festival make a friend at the end of it!

*The Melboourne Writers' Festival runs from Thursday 22 August - Sunday 1 September 2013.*
