#Unearthing The Land and Sea's Best Offerings

*A chat to a few of Australia’s most respected chefs, as they judge some of the finest local produce on the market.*

Judging some of the best produce on the market is no easy task, even for an expert panel with decades of culinary experience behind them. It’s an idea that quickly came to the fore when we caught up with Paul Wilson, Pope Joan chef and owner Matt Wilkinson and Alla Wolf-Tasker, restaurateur and owner of Daylesford’s Lake House Hotel and Restaurant.

Working through categories including: From the Earth, Sea, Paddock and Dairy, for the delicious. magazine produce awards, the judges spent over three hours sampling and comparing food from all over Victoria. Involving a range of criterion, the nominations were carefully and individually scored and tallied to determine whether they make the final national judging round in May.

“Apart from taste, each produce is judged by appearance, packaging and branding, and an overall ‘wow factor’, which is a more arbitrary criteria that can be a combination of all these things, plus other aspects such as sustainable production methods,” says Wilson.

Between bites of ham from Bundoora and alpine strawberries from the Yarra Valley, the judges’ discussions revolved around how Australian food culture has developed in recent years and what this means for farmers as well as consumers.

“The abundance of local, seasonal produce these days is so amazing that it has actually driven the price down on certain things,” Wilkinson says.

Wolf-Tasker, however, thinks quality and diversity of the produce – rather than availability – should drive the local food culture.

“We’ve all gotten so used to getting everything we need from a one-stop shop destination. It should be up to the consumers to take the time to go to the farmer, either at their farm or a farmers’ market, and to get to know what they are putting on their dinner tables.”

While the final judging process, where produce from all over the nation will battle it out, is yet to take place, one thing that all of the Victorian judges agree on is the tremendous range of products available to consumers today. The best thing about it, however, is that getting to know your meat and veg properly can be as simple as making a trip to your nearest farmers’ market over the weekend.
