#Interview: Postsecret founder, Frank Warren

![](/images/interview-postsecret/frank-warren.jpg)

He is “the most trusted stranger in America,” receiving dozens of people’s deepest, darkest (and sometimes just the embarrassing), secrets everyday. Frank Warren has become the internet’s equivalent to the priest in a confessional booth and the PostSecret website, largely unchanged since 2004, is still receiving the most intimate fragments of people’s lives from all over the world. 

It all started almost 10 years ago, when Warren handed out blank postcards addressed to himself - asking people to write down a secret they’ve never divulged to anyone before and to mail back to him anonymously. This resulted in his current collection of cards numbering in the hundreds of thousands, four published anthologies of his favourite secrets (it is rumoured he has at least one of his own in each book) and millions of readers religiously going to the PostSecret website every Sunday.

Ahead of his tour down under, we had a chat to him about PostSecret, his favourite secrets and what it means to be a pseudo-therapist to millions around the world. 

**Delima Shanti:** So PostSecret is apparently the biggest website without ads, when did you realise that this project had taken a life of its own?

**Frank Warren:** Early on in the project; I was receiving postcards from strangers in the mail and scanning and sharing them on the web. In the first week I had maybe a hundred visitors and the next week it grew to a thousand, and weeks after that it was hundreds of thousands. It just grew really fast and hasn’t stopped since. Now I get millions of visitors each month at Postsecret.com. 

**DS:** How does the website fund itself? 

**FW:** Thankfully it’s just through Google, it’s totally free and I don’t have to pay for any servers. I feel very fortunate that I’ve never had to [serve] advertisements on the website to generate revenue, even though it’s received over 500 million visitors.

**DS:** So what else do you do apart from running the site?

**FW:** I’m generally on the computer a bit, going through emails, going to my mailbox to collect secrets (Frank still gets the postcards sent to his house). Fridays and Saturdays I select postcards that will go on the website on Sunday. There’s also a PostSecret play that I’m working on that will come out later this year. But what I’m most excited about is the speaking tour coming up where I’ll get to go to Australia and New Zealand. 

**DS:** How many submissions do you get on any given day?

**FW:** Oh dozens come everyday, and from all around the world. In fact I just scanned one today that’s going to go up on Sunday that came from Australia. 

**DS:** The concept of the website hasn’t changed in almost 10 years, and it seems people’s worries and joys are still the same too, no matter where they’re from. What have you learned about the human experience from the submissions?

**FW:** I think what you’ve picked up is a significant understanding, the idea that everybody’s inner lives are similar all around the world. The secrets that we feel are walls inside of us, if we can find the courage to be vulnerable and share them, we’re able to discover they’re actually bridges connecting us to others. 

**DS:** At the very beginning, why did you decide to get people to mail you their secrets? And why secrets in particular, why not dreams or wishes?

**FW:** That’s a good question actually... I think I always felt that I had this rich interior life, of thoughts and feelings and fears and desires. I thought that if i could create a safe, non-judgemental place where other can share those same things, it could be really special. I was just shocked by how it resonated with people and spread around the world so quickly. 

**DS:** There are quite a lot of really intense confessions on the postcards dealing with possible suicide and depression, how does this affect you? 

**FW:** All of the cards come anonymously, so I’m unable to reach out individually, but I do try help out through promoting suicide prevention resources worldwide. In fact, last year the PostSecret community created the most comprehensive directory of suicide prevention resources around the world at PostSecret International Suicide Prevention Wiki. In fact, over eight years we’ve raised over a million dollars for suicide prevention, so I try to help out in other ways.

**DS:** How about the happy cards, have you ever seen particular ones that just brighten up your day?
**FW:** I like the one that arrived on a Starbucks cup. You guys have Starbucks there right?

**DS:** Yes, of course! 

**FW:** The secret said: “I serve decaf to customers who are rude to me.” There’s another fun one that I’m posting up this Sunday that’s posted on a cookie box and it says: “I’m addicted to boxed cookies. I’m a professional baker.”

**DS:** As the PostSecret community grows over the years, have you seen the cards get more creative?

**FW:** From the very beginning they have been very artistic and creative and I kind of like the authenticity of the secrets combined with the art. But generally my favourite ones are the ones that grab you in the stomach, and maybe it seems like the person who made it had to bleed a little bit to get the secret out.

**DS:** Why do you think people keep on sending you their secrets? What drives them? 

**FW:** I think there’s something about secrets that’s inexhaustible in the same way that we’ll never hear all the poems or hear all the songs there is. 

**DS:** Do you think it is a bit like therapy to people? Maybe a bit like sending a postcard secret to you is like going to confession in a church?

**FW:** I think [sending a postcard to PostSecret] can be helpful. I think going through the ritual of finding the words to take ownership of your secret and putting it on this postcard, and then physically letting it go can be the first step towards a much longer journey of dealing with the secret for a lot of people. 

**DS:** In the TED talk you did you showed a picture showing a pyramid of cards in your house... Do you really keep them all?

**FW:** Yeah, they all come to my home and I keep them all. I think it’s a precious archive. 



**DS:** Do you plan on showing them all somewhere one day? 

**FW:** Maybe I’ll give them all to the Smithsonian.

**DS:** The 10th birthday of PostSecret is coming up in 2014, have you got any plans for a special birthday event yet?

**FW:** Oh yeah... I don’t know, maybe that’ll be the end of it, who knows? I just follow wherever the project leads, preserve the integrity and try not to screw it up. I don’t have any ambitions or goals to take this anywhere at the moment, but I am most excited right now for the Australia/New Zealand tour, I’ve never been to either countries.

**DS:** So can you tell me a bit about what you’ll be doing while you’re in Australia?

**FW:** What I do at PostSecret events is I talk about how the project got started and why I started it. I’ll share one of my secrets to the audience and the event will be multimedia so there’s going to be music, video. I’ll project on the screen cards that were banned from the books by the publishers and postcards that have transformed lives and brought people together. For me the most exciting part is when I invite audience members to share one of their secrets, sometimes to an audience of thousands.
