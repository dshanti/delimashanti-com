#Reasons To Be Pretty: Interview with Actor and Producer Paul Denny

![](/images/rtbp/rtbp-hero.jpg)

Paul Denny is a TV and theatre actor with over 20 years of experience, having made repeat appearances on prime time dramas like Offspring and Lowdown.
 
The AFI-nominated actor is about to star in Neil LaBute's Reasons To Be Pretty, which premieres in Melbourne at St Kilda's Theatreworks this month. The play tells the story of a tight-knit circle of friends that gets a shake-up when one of the lead characters, Greg, gets into trouble with his girlfriend after making an offhand remark about a female co-worker’s looks. The piece explores the obsession today’s society has with good looks and poses the question: “How much is pretty worth?”
 
Aside from acting, Paul is also taking on the less glamorous role of co-producing the play with his wife and co-actor Rebecca Denny. He spoke to Everguide about the challenges faced by actors, why going to the theatre can be like a live footy match and his not-so-secret love for the Sex Pistols and Doctor Who.
 
**Delima Shanti:** You’re working both as an actor and producer on this production... does that bring a different perspective to how you approach both roles, as opposed to if you were working on just one?

**Paul Denny:** Absolutely. There is certainly a great deal more pressure on me in this show because of the dual roles I've taken on. It's not the usual situation where I only have to focus on being an actor and creating the character. On those occasions the bulk of my work happens in the rehearsal room and after hours I can relax a little.
 
On this show I finish rehearsals and then have to come home to a lot of production duties, so the job is ongoing.
 
**DS:** Does that make it difficult to step back and see the bigger picture sometimes?

**PD:** Yes, it does actually. I have to keep reminding myself not to be concerned with production issues (while) in the rehearsal room, and focus on my job as an actor.
 
**DS:** It seems you’ve been drawn to theatre as much as on-screen work. Do you have any particular preference for either? Perhaps tell me a bit about the pros/cons of each medium.

**PD:** I started out working mainly in theatre, although that has changed dramatically. I don't do as much theatre as I'd like these days. In those early days in Brisbane there was very little film and TV work to be found so I relied on theatre as the main source of work. I believe things have changed a lot up there now, and the film/TV industry is pretty healthy.
 
In terms of the pros/cons of each, I would say that theatre is awesome for the immediate gratification you get from performing in front of a live audience. It is also an actor's medium, in that you are more in control of your own performance. The downside of theatre is that by its very nature it is ephemeral, and no matter how great your performance may be, it is 'here today, and gone tomorrow'.
 
Film/TV work is more of a director's medium, and you have far less control. It also consists of a lot of waiting around interspersed with short bursts of intense, focussed activity in front of the camera. Tthis can be very draining after a number of long days on set. On the flip side, I love the level of immediacy required in acting for film & TV, and the fact that your work is seen by hundreds of thousands, or even millions of people. It also pays a lot better, which is always a bonus!
 
**DS:** I think the general public sometimes think they’re almost intimidated with theatre. Do you think that theatre is still seen as a niche form of entertainment?

**PD:** I think that as TV and film is more readily available to everybody it’s obviously going to be more popular. What theatre has in its favour is that each and every performance is going to be different to the one before, so what an audience sees in any given show is unique. Sure, some plays can be less accessible than others, but the same can be said for certain film and TV. I believe that 'great' theatre can be far more involving for the viewer, and can move an audience to laughter or tears to a much greater extent than anything onscreen could ever manage.
 
*Reasons to be Pretty* is a VERY accessible show and has a broad appeal. It is also extremely funny, and it's aimed at people from all walks of life, and will entertain you regardless of whether you've been to the theatre before, or not.

**DS:** How do you think theatre could be made to appeal to people who are quite happy with their TV shows and their blockbuster films?

**PD:** All it takes is seeing just one great theatre show, and I believe someone would be a convert for life. I love watching AFL for example, and I think the difference could be likened to that of watching a game live at the stadium as opposed to just watching it on TV. It is so much more magical and engaging to be at the actual match, and far more memorable as a result.
 
**DS:** That said, being both a TV and stage actor, do you find casting directors have this same preconception about theatre and theatre actors? Or do they get that acting is acting whatever the end product is?

**PD:** I think so. These days there isn't any such thing as 'theatre actors' or 'film/TV actors'. Well, not in Australia anyway. Actors here need to be able to do either/or if they want to sustain a career here. To only focus on one medium is only going to radically limit your employment opportunities.
 
**DS:** Is there a difference with working on stage and on camera?

**PD:** There are many differences, especially in the size of performance required for each. In each medium your performance has to be truthful for it to work. In theatre though, you need your work to be seen and heard by every audience member, including those in the back row.
 
In film and TV the camera is right there up close, and most of your performance is in your eyes. The minutest gesture or facial expression can speak volumes. There is no room for 'showing' the audience what you're feeling, you just make sure you've got the internal workings of the character happening, and feel it, and the camera will pick it all up for you.
 
**DS:** What are some of the big challenges for Australian actors in theatre and/or television today?

**PD:** Well, unemployment is a major challenge for any actor, and always will be. Even our most famous actors don't work all year round, so you have to find things to do in between jobs that can keep the wolves at bay, and ideally, enhance your skills as an actor. Putting on your own show is a great way to keep you 'in the game' and is likely to lead to more paid work down the track.
 
There are many other related avenues you can pursue as an actor, including working in the voice over industry (which I particularly love), as well as writing, directing, producing, etc. The sky's the limit really!
 
**DS:** Ending slightly off track here, but I take it from your Twitter handle, @SEXP1STOL, that you’re a fan of the Sex Pistols?

**PS:** I'm a fan of music in general, but I've always loved what the Sex Pistols did for popular music. They didn't play nice, and they weren't pretty, and they had something to say. They spoke for the underprivileged, and the disenchanted. My favourite movie of all time is The Filth & The Fury, which is a documentary about The Sex Pistols.
 
It charts the band's members from their childhood growing up in a turbulent seventies in the UK, right up to their final disastrous gig in the US before they imploded in a haze of drugs and controversy. It's still amazing to me that they only released one album, and yet they sent shockwaves through the music establishment, and changed everything that happened after them.
 
**DS:** Any other passions apart from music and theatre?

**PD:** Well, I've been a die-hard Doctor Who fan since age seven and have every single book, DVD, video, and CD associated with the programme, right up to its earliest days in November 1963. I'm very much looking forward to the 50th Anniversary celebrations next year, and may even head over to the UK to attend one of the major conventions planned for the celebration in 2013.
 
My dream is to one day play the Doctor. An Academy Award would come a distant second to that. Yeah, I'm a geek at heart I guess.
 
**DS:** OK, final final question. As an actor, are you where you pictured yourself to be when you finished your degree in theatre?

**PD:** No. I thought I'd be playing the Doctor by now...
